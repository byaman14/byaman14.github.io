I am a lead research scientist at Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI). I have received my Ph.D. from  Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Minnesota, under the supervision of [Prof. Mehmet Akçakaya](https://imagine.umn.edu/people/mehmet-ak%C3%A7akaya). I have received a B.Sc. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Istanbul Technical University, Turkey, in 2016. 
My research  interests include computer vision, self-supervised learning, vision-language models, generative models, medical imaging, and autonomous driving.
