I am a lead(staff) research scientist & tech lead at Bosch Center for AI working on autonomous driving. In this role, I lead a team of research scientists on the design and development of foundation models for enhanced and safe end-to-end autonomous driving. Toward this goal, I use techniques from vision-language models, large language models, diffusion models, self-supervised learning, and end-to-end motion planning. 

I have received my Ph.D. from  Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Minnesota, under the supervision of [Prof. Mehmet Akçakaya](https://imagine.umn.edu/people/mehmet-ak%C3%A7akaya). I have received a B.Sc. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Istanbul Technical University, Turkey, in 2016. 
My research  interests include computer vision, self-supervised learning, vision-language models, generative models, medical imaging, and autonomous driving.
