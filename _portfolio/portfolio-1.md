## Self-Supervised Learning
My PhD work focused on self-supervised learning  for solving inverse imaging problems. 

### ZS-SSL: Zero-Shot Self-Supervised Learning

Developed the zero-shot self-supervised learning (ZS-SSL) methodology that performs test time training with a well-defined stopping criterion and tackles out-of-distribution challenges via domain adaptation. This work was published in [ICLR 2022](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=085y6YPaYjP).

### SSDU: Self-Supervised Learning via Data Undersampling

SSDU is the pioneering self-supervised learning work that enables reconstruction without ground-truth data. SSDU splits acquired measurements into two disjoint sets, in which one set is used as input to the network, and the other is used to define the loss function. This work received the 2020 IEEE ISBI Best Paper Award.
