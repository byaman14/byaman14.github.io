### PaPr: Patch Pruning for Faster Inference
![Illustration of MTA](/images/papr.png){: .align-right width="300px"} PaPr is a novel background patch pruning method that can seamlessly operate with ViTs for faster inference (>2x). PaPr is a training-free approach and can be easily plugged into existing token pruning methods for further efficiency. This work was published in [ECCV 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18965).

### VLP: Vision Language Planning
![Illustration of MTA](/images/vlp.png){: .align-right width="300px"} VLP is a vision language planning approach for enhancing end-to-end autonomous driving. VLP is a training-only approach that distills the power of LLMs into the existent autonomous driving stacks for improved performance. This work was published in [CVPR 2024](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Pan_VLP_Vision_Language_Planning_for_Autonomous_Driving_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf).

### ZS-SSL: Zero-Shot Self-Supervised Learning

Developed the zero-shot self-supervised learning (ZS-SSL) methodology that performs test time training with a well-defined stopping criterion and tackles out-of-distribution challenges via domain adaptation. This work was published in [ICLR 2022](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=085y6YPaYjP).

### SSDU: Self-Supervision via Data Undersampling
![Illustration of ZS-SSL](/images/ssdu.png){: .align-right width="300px"}
SSDU is the pioneering self-supervised learning work that enables reconstruction without ground-truth data. SSDU splits acquired measurements into two disjoint sets, in which one set is used as input to the network, and the other is used to define the loss function. This work received the [2020 IEEE ISBI Best Paper Award](https://biomedicalimaging.org/2020/wp-content/uploads/static-html-to-wp/data/dff0d41695bbae509355435cd32ecf5d/best-paper-awards.html).
