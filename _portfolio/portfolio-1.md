% ### MTA: Multimodal Task Alignment
% ![Illustration of MTA](/images/mta.png){: .align-right width="300px"} MTA is a multimodal task alignment approach for joint training of 3D % perception and captioning.  MTA achieves SOTA performance on both perception and captioning without introducing additional complexity

### PaPr: Patch Pruning for Faster Inference
![Illustration of MTA](/images/papr.png) PaPr is a novel background patch pruning method that can seamlessly operate with ViTs for faster inference (>2x). PaPr is a training-free approach and can be easily plugged into existing token pruning methods for further efficiency. 

### VLP: Vision Language Planning
![Illustration of MTA](/images/vlp.png) VLP is a vision language planning approach for enhancing end-to-end autonomous driving. VLP is a training only approach that distills the power of LLMs into the existent autonomous driving stacks for improved performance.

### ZS-SSL: Zero-Shot Self-Supervised Learning

Developed the zero-shot self-supervised learning (ZS-SSL) methodology that performs test time training with a well-defined stopping criterion and tackles out-of-distribution challenges via domain adaptation. This work was published in [ICLR 2022](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=085y6YPaYjP).

### SSDU: Self-Supervised Learning via Data Undersampling

SSDU is the pioneering self-supervised learning work that enables reconstruction without ground-truth data. SSDU splits acquired measurements into two disjoint sets, in which one set is used as input to the network, and the other is used to define the loss function. This work received the [2020 IEEE ISBI Best Paper Award](https://biomedicalimaging.org/2020/wp-content/uploads/static-html-to-wp/data/dff0d41695bbae509355435cd32ecf5d/best-paper-awards.html).
